# CS201 Compiler Construction

The files uploaded are some of the deliverables I had created for two of the mini projects that I have completed for CS201 Compiler Construction at UC Riverside. 


The project instructions are found in the PDF files in each of the Project folders. 

##Project 2 - Local Value Numbering
##Project 3 - Liveness Analysis

Overall, the bulk of the algorithm is found in the two ValueNumbering.cpp for each of the projects where the algorithms model how a compiler would handle the given test files and complete the required tasks as detailed in the instructions PDF and the website . For example, Project 2 should be able to identify redundancies in the code and Project 3 should be able to create a diagram for Liveness Analysis for the test code files.

My summary reports were also included in the upload detailing the deliverable results.
